The Quick switcher lets you search and open notes using only your keyboard.

To open a note using the Quick switcher:

1. Press `Ctrl+O` (or `Cmd+O` on macOS) to open the Quick switcher.
1. Type to search for a note by name or alias.
1. Navigate to the note using the arrow keys.
1. Press `Enter` to open the selected note.

If the text doesn't match any notes, you can press `Enter` to create a note with that name. Even if the text matches one or more similar notes, you can still create a note with the exact name by pressing `Shift+Enter`.

You can open the selected note in a new pane by pressing `Ctrl+Enter` (or `Cmd+Enter` on macOS).

> [!tip] Toggle between two notes
> If the search term is empty, the Quick switcher shows the most recent notes. Toggle between two notes by opening the Quick switcher, pressing the `Down` arrow, and then pressing `Enter`.

Панель обратных состояит из двух разделов – «Упоминания со ссылокой» и «Упоминания без ссылки»:

As you can see, from this document, there is currently one entry in each section. Under Linked mentions you can see that I made a link to this document in the [[Связанная область]] note. But, you can also see under Unlinked mentions that I wrote the name of this note but did not make it a link.

This can be a very powerful way of seeing connections between your notes that you did not know you were making when you wrote them. If, for example, you have a note named for a concept that comes up often in your field, you will be able to see easily when it is mentioned in other notes, and thus understand relationships between ideas you might not have otherwise.

If a reference appears in the Unlinked mentions, and you want to link it, hovering over the text will bring up a Link button. Clicking this will automatically surround the highlighted text in the referenced note with brackets, making it into an explicit link.

You can also create a separate, dedicated backlinks pane for a note under the More Options menu. This will be a [[Связанная область]] connected to the note, and can be moved around anywhere, as described in [[Расположение области]]. There's also an option to do this in the [[Палитра команд]].

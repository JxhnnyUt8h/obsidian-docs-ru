> **We're currently reorganizing the Obsidian documentation.** As we expect to make big changes in the near future, we ask that you don't plan any major translation work until we're done with these changes.

If you know another language, preferably natively, you can help translate the Obsidian user interface or the documentation.

To help translate the user interface, submit a pull request to the [translations repository](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-translations).

To help improve our documentation, submit a pull request to the [documentation repository](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-docs).

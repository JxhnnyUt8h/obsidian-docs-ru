Obsidian’s official website is at https://obsidian.md/.

It’s useful for:

1. Grabbing the latest installer if your installer version is too old;
2. Register an account if you want to purchase [[Catalyst license]], [[Commercial license]], [[Introduction to Obsidian Sync|Obsidian Sync]], or [[Obsidian Publish]];
3. Playing a [quiz game](https://obsidian.md/quiz) if you’re confident with your knowledge of the community plugins and themes.

## The rules

These are the behaviors we do not tolerate.

### Major offenses

- **Harassment**: including offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion, as well as sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual or romantic attention.
- **Threats**: threatening someone physically or verbally. For example, threatening to publicize sensitive information about someone’s personal life.

### Minor offenses and other behaviors

- **Blatant -isms**: saying things that are explicitly racist, sexist, homophobic, etc. For example, arguing that some people are less intelligent because of their gender, race or religion. Small mistakes made in conversation are not code of conduct violations. However, repeating something after it has been pointed out to you, or antagonizing or arguing with someone who has pointed out your subtle -ism is considered a minor offense.
- **Belligerence**: deliberately attempting to make others feel bad, name-calling, singling out others for derision or exclusion. For example, telling someone they’re not a real programmer or that they don’t belong.
- **Being especially unpleasant**: for example, if we’ve received reports from multiple members of annoying or rude behavior.

#### Other behaviors

- **Sea-lioning**: continuously pursuing an agenda by questioning and provoking other members. Individual provocations and questions are often perfectly acceptable, but in the case of sea-lioning, they accumulate to unhealthy levels, creating a hostile and negative conversation.
- **"Feed me"**: asking others to solve problems for you without putting in any effort yourself. This is particularly egregious when the problem-solving is non-trivial and yet the user begs for someone else to do the work for them.
- **Campaigning**: continuously making the same requests. This applies to both feature requests and to requests for help. Do not post the same question in multiple places in short timeframes, and do not ask developers for the same features or bug fixes repeatedly.
- **Parasitism**: self-promoting of yours or others' initiatives without contributing to the community otherwise. We encourage self-promotion (it is awesome to see what Obsidian users are up to) but will not tolerate users whose only purpose in the community is to post links or solicitations to initiatives outside the community.

## Motivation

We at Obsidian want to create the best community for knowledge management. We want everyone to be able to seek help, help others, and share their experience, without fear or embarrassment.

In order to get there, all of our members are expected to be nice to each other in all interactions, whether it's on our Discord server or on our forum.

"Be nice" is a vague instruction, though. To make sure we're on the same page what's  nice and what's not, we've adopted the code of conduct above.

As the community grows, we cannot rely on all members to be nice, although the vast majority of our members show exceptional respect towards each other. Adopting a more formal code of conduct — and enforcing it — helps maintain a vital and healthy community.

## Please report violations

The code of conduct is enforced by our moderator team, but we cannot monitor every single interaction in our community. This is why we rely on our members to help us improve our community by reporting violations of our code of conduct.

Even if you're not the victim, you can still report violations as a witness.

We'll keep the identity of the reporter as confidential as we can.

### Report on Discord

In \#bots-land-mute-me channel, or any other channel, type `!report @offenderName Please write your reason here`. Your message will disappear immediately, and a report will be sent to our moderator only channel.

### Report on the forum

Please flag the relevant conversation with a reason, and our moderator team will investigate.

## Enforcement

> [!abstract] Summary
> A verified major offense results in an immediate ban.
> A verified minor offense results in a warning; after that a second verified violation results in a ban.

If our moderator team witnesses or receives a report about a [[#major offense]], we will contact the offender to have a conversation with them and verify what has happened, and they will be removed from our community.

If our moderator team witnesses or receives a report about a [[#minor offense]], we will contact the member involved to explain why their behavior was unacceptable, and warn them that a second code of conduct violation will result in us removing them from our community.

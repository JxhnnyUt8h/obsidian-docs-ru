### Copy and paste

When you see something useful online, you can simply select the text, copy, and paste in Obsidian. Obsidian will try to convert it into proper Markdown so that it fits right in.

If you only wish to copy the text without the formatting, please use `Ctrl-Shift-V` on Windows and Linux and `Cmd-Shift-V` on macOS to do so.

### Use a clipper extension

Because Obsidian accepts any Markdown file, you can clip entire web pages by clipping to Markdown files and downloading them into your vault.

death_au's "MarkDownload" browser extension works well for this purpose. You can get it for:

- [Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/markdownload-markdown-web/pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi)
- [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/markdownload/)
- [Microsoft Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/markdownload-markdown-w/hajanaajapkhaabfcofdjgjnlgkdkknm)

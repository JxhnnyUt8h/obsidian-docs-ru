If you hold down `Alt` (`Option` on mac) and click, you can create multiple cursors, one in each location you have clicked. 
If you want to create multiple cursors in consecutive rows, hold `Alt-Shift-Click` (`Option-Shift-Click` on mac) and drag the mouse pointer.
This can be useful when modifying a lot of lines in the same way, for example putting `-` at the beginning of multiple lines to turn them into a list, or appending `[[` to a series of links you've copied from elsewhere. 

To cancel multiple cursors, either click somewhere in the note (without a modifier key), or hit escape.

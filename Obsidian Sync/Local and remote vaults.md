Obsidian stores your notes in a _local_ vault on your computer. If you want to access your notes from other devices, you need to share your local vault with those devices.

[[Introduction to Obsidian Sync|Obsidian Sync]] makes this easier by letting you synchronize your local vault with a _remote_ vault that lives on Obsidian's servers.

You can connect multiple local vaults to your remote vault. When you make a change to a local vault, that change is saved to the connected remote vault. Your change is then synced across all the local vaults you've connected to that remote vault.

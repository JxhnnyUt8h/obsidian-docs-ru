Learn how to share a remote vault with another user.

Collaborators need an active Obsidian Sync subscription to access a shared vault. Joining a shared remote vault doesn't count towards your [[Limitations#How many remote vaults can I have?|vault limit]].

Except for adding new collaborators, collaborators receive the same permissions as the vault owner. Fine-grained permissions aren't supported.

If the remote vault is [[Obsidian Sync/Security and privacy|end-to-end encrypted]], collaborators need to enter the encryption password when they set up the vault.

> Avoid working on the same note at the same time as it may lead to changes being lost during the sync process.

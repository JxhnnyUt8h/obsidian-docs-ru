Obsidian has several options for dealing with deleted files, depending on your needs.

- By default, deleted files are sent to your system trash. Here you can use whatever means your system has for recovering files you've accidentally deleted. 
- Deleted files can be sent to a special `.trash` directory in your Vault. This can be useful if you want the ability to recover your Vault files separate from your system trash. 
- You can also set obsidian to just delete files without possibility of recovery. 

These options can be found in Settings â†’ Files & Links.

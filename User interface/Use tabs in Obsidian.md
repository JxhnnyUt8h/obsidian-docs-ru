You can open as many tabs as you want in Obsidian. You can also arrange tabs to create custom layouts that persist until the next time you open the application.

## Open a new tab

At the top of the application window, next to the last tab on the right, select **New tab** (plus icon). Or, use a keyboard shortcut:

- **Windows and Linux:** `Ctrl+t`
- **macOS:** `Cmd+t`

## Open a new tab in a new tab group

To open a tab in a new tab group, use the following keyboard shortcuts:

- **Windows and Linux:** `Ctrl+Shift+t`
- **macOS:** `Cmd+Shift+t`

## Open a link

Select a link in Obsidian to open it in the active tab.

To open a link in a new tab, press `Ctrl` (or `Cmd` on macOS) and select the link.

## Organize your tabs and windows

Every tab belongs to a _tab group_. You can drag and drop tabs to rearrange them within a tab group, move them to a different tab group, or create a new tab group. On desktop, you can drag tabs out of their window to open them in a separate _popout window_.

Tabs in sidebars only show the icon. Hover over the icon to show a tooltip with the tab title.

### Arrange tabs

To change the order of your tabs, drag the tab along the tabs in the tab group. 

As you drag a tab, _drop zones_—areas onto which you can move the tab—become highlighted. The drop zone determines where to insert the tab. Some tabs can only be in of the sidebars.

### Split a tab group

Right-click a tab and select **Split right** or **Split down** to create a new tab group with that tab. 

You can also split a tab group by dragging a tab to the bottom of another tab.

### Move tab to a new window

**Drag and drop:**

- Select and drag the tab outside of the application window to open it in a new window.

**Command palette:**

- Open the Command Palette, and select **Move current tab to new window**.

### Move a tab to a different window

To move a tab to another existing window, drag the tab to the window you want to move it to.

### Pin a tab

To pin a tab, right-click the tab and select **Pin**. Links in a pinned tab always open in a separate tab.

To unpin a pinned tab, right-click the tab and select **Unpin**.

## Switch to a different tab

Select a tab to switch to it. Or, use a keyboard shortcut:

- Press `Ctrl+Tab` to switch to the next tab.
- Press `Ctrl+Shift+Tab` to switch to the previous tab.
- Press `Ctrl+1` to switch to the first tab on the left. 
- Press `Ctrl` together with any number from `2` to `8` to switch to that tab.
- Press `Ctrl+9` to open the last tab on the right regardless of how many tabs you have.

To open and switch to a recently closed tab, press `Ctrl+Shift+t` (or `Cmd+Shift+t` on macOS).

## Stack tab groups

You can stack tabs to slide them over other tabs in the same tab group.

To stack notes, select the down arrow at the upper right corner of the tab group, and then select **Stack notes**.

> Tab stacks are based on [Andy Matushak's sliding notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/).

## Linked views

_Linked views_ are tabs that reference a different tab. When the content of the referenced tab changes, the linked view changes as well.

For note tabs, you can use the following plugins as linked views:

- [[Graph view]] (local)
- [[Backlinks]]
- [[Outline]]

To open a linked view for a note tab:

1. Select **More options** (three dots icon) in the upper right corner of the note.
1. Under **Open linked view**, select the linked view you want to open.

- You can save and restore window layouts using the [[Workspaces]] plugin.

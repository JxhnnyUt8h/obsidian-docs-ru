Title bar is the bar at the very top of Obsidian.

### Window title

The window title, which is the text at the very center of the title bar, indicates the name of the current vault, as well as the current version number.

### Navigation

At the left end of the title bar, there are two arrow buttons that let you go back and forward. Because how common they are used, we recommend using the hotkeys instead.

### Window management

At the right end of the title bar, you have the buttons to:

- Minimize the window;
- Maximize the window if it’s not maximized, or restore previous size if maximized;
- Close the window.


### Native title bar

The title bar in Obsidian is custom-built and may not have feature parity with the native title bar that you’re used to on your operating system.

Currently you can’t disable the custom title bar. If it would be helpful to you, consider echoing your voice in [this feature request](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/add-option-to-enable-disable-frameless-mode/6991).

## Obsidian Catalyst and Unlimited

[[Catalyst license]] purchases and Obsidian Unlimited donations are to support Obsidian's development. ==They are not refundable.==

Although they might give you exclusive early access to insider builds or feature betas (such as mobile app or other major features), we do not sell them as a product.

We cannot provide refunds for Catalyst purchases. Thanks for your understanding!

If there is any issue with a transaction, please reach out to support@obsidian.md or on Discord.

## All other services

For all other services and licenses, including [[Commercial license]], [[Obsidian Publish]], and [[Obsidian Sync]], you can request a full refund within 3 days of purchase with no questions asked. Please reach out to support@obsidian.md or on Discord.

Beyond 3 days, if you need a refund due to exceptional circumstances, feel free to reach out to us too.

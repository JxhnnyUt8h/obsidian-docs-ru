Obsidian Unlimited is a way to contribute a custom amount to Obsidian develop as you wish. You can also contribute multiple times at any time.

You can find this option at the bottom of the page in [your Obsidian account page](https://obsidian.md/account) after logging in.

Special thanks to the VIPs who proposed this "feature" to support Obsidian even more.

==Contributing to Obsidian Unlimited does not let you give any additional features or benefits.== For this reason, we recommend upgrading to [[Catalyst license]] first, if you're looking to access [[Insider builds]] or get cool badges in our community.

Note: we've set the minimal amount to $5 (so that processing fees would make sense).

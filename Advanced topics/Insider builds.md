Insider builds are experimental versions of Obsidian that are released to Catalyst license owners, on an opt-in basis.

Please note that insider builds are less stable than public versions, so if you prefer a smoother version, you don't have to enable it.

### How to enable insider build

If you are a [[Catalyst license|Catalyst supporter]], you have access to Insider Builds before the general public. To access these, go to Settings => Account, and log in with the password you used on the Obsidian site. Then go to Settings => About, and turn on Insider Builds there.

### Report issues

If you're on our Discord server, you can go to the #insider-build channel to report issues. If you're filing a bug report on the forum, be sure to note the version you're using, so that we can improve it before rolling it out to everyone.

## Mobile insider builds

If you're a holder of the [[Catalyst license]], you may wish to join our [[Insider builds|insider builds]] for mobile.

To keep feedback and releases centralized as we don't have the capacity to debug and collect feedback via email, we ask Catalyst users who would like to beta test to go through the following steps:

### Step 1: join our Discord

First of all, please [join our Discord](https://discord.gg/veuWUTm).  

### Step 2: claim your Catalyst badge to access \#insider-build-mobile channel

If you don't have your badge yet, [[Catalyst license#Discord badge|you can get it in your Account page]].

### Step 3: get the app via TestFlight (iOS) or APK (Android)

Once you get your badge, you should be able to see the `#insider-mobile` channel along with regular channels like `#general` and `#publish`.

To find the instructions for installing the mobile apps, go to `#insider-mobile`, and open pinned messages.

On Discord web and desktop, you can open pinned messages of a channel by clicking on the pushpin icon near the search bar at the top. On Discord mobile, you'll need to swipe left to reveal the right sidebar and tap on the pushpin icon at the top.

For the iOS app, look for the TestFlight link. Make sure to open the link on your iPhone or iPad, rather than on your computer. For the Android app, install the APK from the latest pinned messages if there are several of them.

### How do I provide feedback?

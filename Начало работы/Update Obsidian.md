Obsidian checks for new updates regularly. When a new update is available, Obsidian applies it when you restart the application.

## Check for an update and the current version

Open **Settings** ->  **About**.

You can find the current Obsidian version and installer version in the top-left corner.

To apply any available updates, click **Relaunch**.

## Disable automatic updates

If you prefer to update Obsidian manually, you can disable automatic updates.

1. Open **Settings** ->  **About**.
2. Disable **Automatic updates**.

## Troubleshooting

Some features may depend on a more recent installer version. If you experience issues with a recently added feature, consider [[Download and install Obsidian|reinstalling Obsidian]] to update the installer version.

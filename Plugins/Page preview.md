Page preview lets you preview a page when you hover the cursor over an internal link, without needing to navigate to that page.

In addition to editor, you can preview notes in several other parts of Obsidian, such as [[File explorer]], [[Search]], and [[Backlinks]].

To preview a page while in Editing view, press `Ctrl` (or `Cmd` on macOS) while hovering the cursor over the link.

> [!tip]
> In the plugin settings, you can configure Page preview to only open the preview automatically, or only when you press `Ctrl` (or `Cmd` on macOS).

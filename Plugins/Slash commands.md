Slash commands allow the user to invoke any of Obsidian's commands while writing in the editor, simply by inserting a `/` character. 

After inserting a `/` character, the editor will present the user with a searchable list of available commands. Continue writing e.g., the name of a command to search the list. 

To run a command via slash commands:
1. While writing in the editor, insert a `/` character.
2. Start typing the name of the command you want to run to search the list of available commands.
3. Navigate to the command using the arrow keys.
4. Press enter.

To exit the slash command search without invoking a command, hit `esc` or insert a `space`.

> [!TIP] Fuzzy matching
> Like the [[Command palette]], searching for a slash command supports fuzzy matching, which lets you search commands even if you don't know their exact names. For example, type "scf" to find the "Save current file" command.

The Command Palette is enabled by default, as it is a very useful way to access nearly all the features of Obsidian without having to remember key strokes. Type `Ctrl/Cmd+P` to activate, then simply type in the name of the command. If a command has a hotkey, it will appear in on the right side.

Custom shorcuts can be added to the Command Palette in Settings -> Keymap. Click on the `*` icon to the right of each key listed and type whatever key combination you would like.

### Usage tips

- To see a list of all commands along with their shortcut, don't type anything into the prompt. The arrow keys will move up and down the list, and `Return` will activate the command. 

- Search in the command palette is fuzzy, so you can type part of the word to get matches. For example, you can use `trm` to search for "Toggle read mode".

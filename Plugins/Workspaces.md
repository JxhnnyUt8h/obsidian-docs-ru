The Workspaces plugin lets you save and load "workspaces". Each workspace includes pane layout, sidebar state (expanded or collapsed), and file open states.

### Save a workspace

Either click on the workspace icon in the ribbon to open "Manage workspaces".

Give the current layout a new name, click on "Save", and it will appear in the list below.

### Load a workspace

To load or restore a workspace, either open "Manage workspaces" and click on the "Load" button next to the workspace you wish to load, or use the "Load workspaces" command to bring up a command-palette-like interface to search and choose workspaces.


### Commands

This plugin has two commands that you can access through [[Command palette]]: manage workspaces and load workspaces. You can also define hotkeys for them.

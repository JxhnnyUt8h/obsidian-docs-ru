Random note does just that, opens a note at random from your Vault. Many people find this useful for surfacing thoughts they had not considered in a long time, or spot checking for things that they may have forgotten to link.

After you enable the Random Note plugin, you can create a [[Custom hotkeys|custom hotkey]] that opens a note at random.

It allows you to convert from other variations of Markdown format and link convention to Obsidian format.

Right now you can convert:

- Roam #tags to [[tags]]
- Roam `^^highlight^^` to `==highlight==`
- Bear `::highlight::` to `==highlight==`.
- Zettelkasten `[[UID]]` links to full links `[[UID File Name]]`
- Zettelkasten `[[UID]]` links to pretty links `[[UID File Name|File Name]]`, which will show up as just `File Name`

The Obsidian team takes security seriously. This page explains the risks involved when installing community plugins, and what the Obsidian team does to address them.

> [!tip]
> If you're working with sensitive data and wish to install a community plugin, we recommend that you perform an independent security audit before using it.

## Restricted mode

By default, Obsidian runs in Restricted Mode to prevent third-party code execution. Only disable Restricted mode if you trust the authors of the plugins that you install.

To turn off Restricted mode:

1. Open **Settings**.
1. In the side menu, select **Community plugins**.
1. Select **Turn on community plugins**.

To turn on Restricted mode:

1. Open **Settings**.
1. In the side menu, select **Community plugins**.
1. Next to **Restricted mode**, select **Turn on**.

Installed plugins remain in your vault even if you turn on Restricted mode, but are ignored by Obsidian.

## Plugin capabilities

Due to technical reasons, Obsidian is unable to reliably restrict plugins to specific permissions or access levels. As a result, consider the following examples of what community plugins can do:

- Community plugins can access files on your computer.
- Community plugins can connect to internet.
- Community plugins can install additional programs.

## Plugin review process

Community plugins undergo an initial review when they are submitted to the plugin store. The Obsidian team is still small and unable to manually review every new release of community plugins.

Instead, we rely on the help of the community to identify and report issues with plugins.

- If you find any security flaws with a community plugin, create an issue on the plugin repository on GitHub.
- If you suspect that a community plugin is malicious, report it by sending an email to support@obsidian.md, or by sending a DM to our moderators.

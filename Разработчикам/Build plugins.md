Learn how you can extend Obsidian with more features by building your own plugins and sharing them with the community.

## Quickstart

The easiest way to get started with Obsidian plugin development is by using the [Obsidian Sample Plugin](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-sample-plugin).

> [!danger] Before you start
> Don't develop plugins in your main vault. When you develop a plugin, one mistake can lead to unintentional modifications to your vault. You also risk permanently deleting your vault.

1. Clone the sample plugin.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-sample-plugin.git
   mv obsidian-sample-plugin your-plugin-id
   cd your-plugin-id
   ```

1. Install dependencies using NPM or Yarn.

   ```bash
   # Using NPM
   npm install

   # Using Yarn
   yarn install
   ```

1. Rebuild plugin whenever you edit the code.

   ```bash
   # Using NPM
   npm run dev

   # Using Yarn
   yarn run dev
   ```

1. Install the plugin to your vault.

   ```bash
   mkdir $YOUR_VAULT_PATH/.obsidian/plugins/your-plugin-id
   mv main.js styles.css manifest.json $VAULT_PATH/.obsidian/plugins/your-plugin-id
   ```

1. Restart Obsidian.

aliases: Using Obsidian URI
---
Obsidian URI is a custom URI protocol supported by Obsidian that lets you trigger various actions, such as opening a note or creating a note.

It is commonly used on macOS and mobile apps for automation and cross-app workflows.

Obsidian URIs are typically in this format:

```
obsidian://action?param1=value&param2=value
```

The `action` parameter is the action that you would like to perform.

> [!warning] Encoding
> Ensure that your values are properly URI encoded. For example, forward slash characters `/` must be encoded as `%2F` and space characters must be encoded as `%20`.
> 
 This is especially important because an improperly encoded "reserved" character may break the interpretation of the URI. [See here for details](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding).

## Register Obsidian URI

On Windows and macOS, running the app once should be sufficient to register the Obsidian URI protocol on your computer.

On Linux, it is a much more involved process:

1. Ensure you create a `obsidian.desktop` file. [See here for details](https://developer.gnome.org/documentation/guidelines/maintainer/integrating.html#desktop-files).
2. Ensure that your desktop file specifies the `Exec` field as `Exec=executable %u`. The `%u` is used to pass the `obsidian://` URIs to the app.
3. If you're using the AppImage installer, you may have to unpack it using `Obsidian-x.y.z.AppImage --appimage-extract`. Then make sure the `Exec` directive points to the unpacked executable.

## Open notes

Opens an Obsidian vault, or open a file within that vault.

### Examples

- `obsidian://open?vault=my%20vault`
  This opens the vault `my vault`. If the vault is already open, focus on the window.

- `obsidian://open?vault=ef6ca3e3b524d22f`
  This opens the vault identified by the ID `ef6ca3e3b524d22f`.

- `obsidian://open?vault=my%20vault&file=my%20note`
  This opens the note `my note.md` in the vault `my vault`, assuming the file exists.

- `obsidian://open?path=%2Fhome%2Fuser%2Fmy%20vault%2Fpath%2Fto%2Fmy%20note`
  This will look for any vault that contains the path `/home/user/my vault/path/to/my note`. Then, the rest of the path is passed to the `file` parameter. For example, if a vault exists at `/home/user/my vault`, then this would be equivalent to `file` parameter set to `path/to/my note`.


> [!tip] Open a heading or block
> With proper URI encoding, you can navigate to a heading or block within a note. `Note%23Heading` would navigate to the heading called "Heading", whereas `Note%23%5EBlock` would navigate to the block called "Block".

### Parameters

- `vault` can be either the vault name or the vault ID[^1].
- `file` can be either a file name, or a path from the vault root to the specified file. If the file extension is `md`, the extension can be omitted.
- `path` an absolute file system path to a file.
  - Using this parameter will override both `vault` and `file`.
  - This will cause the app to search for the most specific vault which contains the specified file path.
  - Then the rest of the path replaces the `file` parameter.

## Open search

This Obsidian URI endpoint opens [[Поиск]] in the specified vault, and optionally perform a search query.

### Examples

- `obsidian://search?vault=my%20vault`
  This opens the vault `my vault`, and opens [[Поиск]].

- `obsidian://search?vault=my%20vault&query=Obsidian`
  This opens the vault `my vault`, opens [[Поиск]], and performs a search for `Obsidian`.

### Parameters

- `vault` can be either the vault name, or the vault ID[^1]. Same as action `open`.
- `query` (optional) The search query to perform.

## Create note

This URI endpoint creates a new note in the vault, optionally with some content.

### Examples

- `obsidian://new?vault=my%20vault&name=my%20note`
  This opens the vault `my vault`, and creates a new note called `my note`.
- `obsidian://new?vault=my%20vault&path=path%2Fto%2Fmy%20note`
  This opens the vault `my vault`, and creates a new note at `path/to/my note`.

### Parameters

- `vault` can be either the vault name, or the vault ID[^1]. Same as action `open`.
- `name` the file name to be created. If this is specified, the file location will be chosen based on your "Default location for new notes" preferences.
- `file` a vault absolute path, including the name. Will override `name` if specified.
- `path` a globally absolute path. Works similar to the `path` option in the `open` action, which will override both `vault` and `file`.
- `content` (optional) the contents of the note.
- `silent` (optional) include this parameter if you don't want to open the new note.
- `append` (optional) include this parameter to append to an existing file if one exists.
- `overwrite` (optional) overwrite an existing file if one exists, but only if `append` isn't set.
- `x-success` (optional) see [[#x-callback-url]].

## Integrate with Hook

This Obsidian URI endpoint is to be used with [Hook](https://hookproductivity.com/). 

### Example

`obsidian://hook-get-address`

### Parameters

- `vault` (optional) can be either the vault name, or the vault ID[^1]. If not provided, the current or last focused vault will be used.
- `x-success` (optional) see [[#x-callback-url]].
- `x-error` (optional) see [[#x-callback-url]].

If `x-success` is defined, this API will use it as the x-callback-url. Otherwise, it will copy a Markdown link of the current focused note to the clipboard, as an `obsidian://open` URL.

## Use x-callback-url parameters

Some endpoints will accept the x-callback-url parameters `x-success` and `x-error`. When it's provided, Obsidian will provide the following to the `x-success` callback:

- `name` the name of the file, without the file extension.
- `url` the `obsidian://` URI for this file.
- `file` (desktop only) the `file://` URL for this file.

For example, if Obsidian receives
`obsidian://.....x-success=myapp://x-callback-url`, the response would be `myapp://x-callback-url?name=...&url=obsidian%3A%2F%2Fopen...&file=file%3A%2F%2F...`

## Shorthand formats

In addition to the formats above, there are two more "shorthand" formats available to open vaults and files:

1. `obsidian://vault/my vault/my note` is equivalent to `obsidian://open?vault=my%20vault&file=my%20note`.
2. `obsidian:///absolute/path/to/my note` is equivalent to `obsidian://open?path=%2Fabsolute%2Fpath%2Fto%2Fmy%20note`.

[^1]: Vault ID is the random 16-character code assigned to the vault, for example `ef6ca3e3b524d22f`. This ID is unique per folder on your computer. There isn't an easy way to find this ID yet, one will be offered at a later date in the vault switcher. Currently it can be found in `%appdata%/obsidian/obsidian.json` for Windows. For macOS, replace `%appdata%` with `~/Library/Application Support/`. For Linux, replace `%appdata%` with `~/.config/`.
